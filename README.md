# TriviaGame
A hip hop trivia game for Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.
#Assignment
The assignment was to create a trivia game that included a timer for each individual question. Upon the timer running out, the user's question would be marked incorrect, a losing screen would load and the user would then be taken to the next question. At the end of the game, the user would be able to choose to play again or exit the page as well as be provided a score of wrong and right. 
#Implementation
Need to review this project to better summarize how I coded this and why I coded it the way I did.
